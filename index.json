However, the improved economy strongly depends on the energy management strategy. Traditional rule-based strategies are no more practical considering the increasing complexity in control objectives. In this study, an adaptive online Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is developed, which learned an energy management strategy with a near-optimal performance. A novel hybrid approach is proposed to integrate the agent into the existing rule-based hybrid control unit architecture with a limited operation domain for more practicality and suitability to series-production control systems. Dynamic Programming (DP) and rule-based strategy are used to benchmark the developed RL agent performance. The objective is to minimize the vehicle’s total fuel consumption and the frequent engine on/off switching to improve driver comfort and vehicle drivability. Several RL-based algorithms have been experimented and as a result, an Extended-Deep Q-Network (E-DQN) agent is proposed by this paper, trained on one cycle, and deployed on two other cycles with different onboard energy levels to evaluate the performance. The paper findings showed that E-DQN outperformed the rule-based strategy achieving up to 10.46% improvement in fuel economy closer to the DP performance alongside providing adequate compliance with the vehicle drivability and driver comfort objectives.","tags":["Action masking","Deep Q-networks","Functional architecture","Reinforcement learning","Energy management strategy","Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles"],"title":"Extended-deep Q-network: A functional reinforcement learning-based energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomislav Bukic","Amr Mousa","Milan Zivadinovic","Bernhard Peischl","Harisyam Manda","Wolfgang Koenig","Armin Traussnig","Charles F.

Accordingly, the calibration processes for such systems have become more complex and thus error prone and tedious. Moreover, the derived control policies are not easily transferable between different vehicle configurations, hence, the calibration effort is increasing dramatically with each configuration change. Therefore, the reduction of such efforts needed to setup the control policy is inevitable to further reduce cost of drivetrain development. The proposed methodology therefore is an important means to make BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) more attractive for car buyers. The fast development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is opening the door to numerous opportunities and applications in the automotive industry. We utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to design appropriate control strategies for different vehicle systems, thus improving the conventional approaches and reducing the development effort. Combining the expertise in simulation and big data, we propose a cloud-based solution that runs a high-fidelity simulation to train, test and deploy the thermal management control strategy for a fleet of BEVs. The benefits, among others, are that the RL-based control policies can be designed more rapidly and run more efficient than the traditional rule-based approaches. After deploying the initial model trained against the simulation, we have the capability of collecting data from a fleet of vehicles operating with the latest control strategy. Using collected data, we iteratively train and customize the strategy throughout the operation time. We have tested the above-mentioned framework on the use case of cabin heating mode selection for BEVs. Our RL agents are trained and evaluated in a model-in-the-loop simulation environment. The policy evaluation is based on the agents’ performance on representative vehicle test measurements (drive cycles). The metrics are selected to quantify the energy efficiency and comfort individually, as well as aggregated to enable a fair comparison. Notably the trained agents achieved better results than the original control policy on most of the individual metrices and significantly better results on the aggregated metric. At this moment, our framework is tested against simulated vehicle fleet. The first reasonable research question is if the trained control system can be directly transferred to the real vehicle, or whether additional adjustments must be performed to achieve the needed flexibility. Another open question refers to the adequate combination of RL algorithms to achieve even better performance on telemetry data from a connected fleet. Time will tell if the idealized case with continuing on-policy training, or the more complex case using the policy-agnostic offline algorithms, will provide the stronger solution. The main technical contribution of our work is the use case agnostic framework which iteratively improves a conventional rule-based control strategy. Following the automotive V-model, the design-, implementation-, and testing -phase is strictly separated from the in-use phase of a vehicle function. To leverage historic data from the in-use phase, our framework disrupts this classical model and embeds the DevOps and ML-Ops practices into the automotive engineering process. In this article we suggest a framework which automates the complex and time-consuming creation process of control strategies. The trained control policies provide better results and allow for a continuous improvement after they are finally deployed on a fleet of vehicles.","tags":[],"title":"Advanced Reinforcement Learning-Based Thermal Management Strategy For Battery Electric Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amr Mousa","Gerhard Benedikt Weiss"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"506279f9891ee0e134782027d0a303bb","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/conference-paper/2022_sae/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2022_sae/","section":"publication","summary":"Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) achieve significant fuel economy by utilizing advanced energy management strategies in controlling the power distribution decision in real-time. Traditional heuristic approaches bring no additional benefits, including efficiency and development cost, considering the increasing complexity in control objectives. This paper extends a previous study of the same problem (RL) and vehicle topology to develop a Reinforcement Learning agent by investigating the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Rainbow-DQN with its variants, PPO and A3C, against the baseline rule-based and Dynamic Programming (DP) strategies. The developed RL agent is optimizing challenging control objectives such as fuel economy, vehicle drivability and driver comfort. The Rainbow-DQN is studied separately to optimize the agent compared to all the algorithm variants and after wards, the best performing variant is compared to tuned PPO and A3C agents. Proper evaluation criteria is defined and the concerned agents are tested with nine different scenarios to examine the generalization capabilities and performance robustness. The results revealed that the A3C agent surplussed both the PPO and the Rainbow-DQN achieving a maximum performance of 98.43% of the DP with a robustness of 97.32% ± 0.78 for the other cycles and an average of 177.7 sec for each engine start compared to 96.3 sec for the rule-based approach.

However, the improved economy of PHEVs strongly depends on the control strategy that decides on the power distribution between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the electric battery. Traditional rule-based control strategies are no more practical considering the increasing and more complex control objectives introduced by the emerging technologies such as automated driving and connected vehicles. In this study, an advanced Energy Management Strategy (EMS) based on Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is developed. DDP solves a finite-horizon optimization problem given the driving cycle a priori to obtain a global optimal vehicle power distribution that contributes mostly to the fuel economy improvements. DDP results are used to benchmark the subsequent RL-developed algorithms’ performance. In the newly proposed control strategy, an adaptive online learning RL agent is introduced into the existing Hybrid Control Unit (HCU) architecture solving the EMS for near-optimal solutions. The objective is to minimize the vehicle's expected total fuel consumption with a proper battery depletion rate besides penalizing the frequent engine on/off switching. Several RL-based algorithms have been experimented with using a vehicle model simulation. As a result, an Extended Deep Q-Network (E-DQN) agent is proposed by the thesis, trained on one cycle, and deployed on two other cycles to evaluate the performance.

In response to AIAA aircraft design competition (undergraduate-team category) “Hybrid-Electric General Aviation (HEGAA) 2018”, hyBIRD aircraft family is presented in this design report. hyBIRD is a team of four undergraduate students from the University of Science and Technology at Zewail City, Egypt. The team worked on designing a family of aircraft for an entry in service (EIS) in 2028 for the 4-seater aircraft and 2030 for the 6-seater based on the future technology. This required forecasting the technology trends for the powertrain components and studying the similar airplanes market, in the same category, which helped identifying our competitive edge and selling point. Advanced design approaches were performed throughout the whole design process such as Integrated Reconfigurable Matrix of Alternatives (IRMA) for aircraft configuration selection, powertrain sizing optimization, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and composites FEA analysis. hyBIRD aircraft is an all-composite airframe with serial hybrid propulsion system utilizing a turbo-normalized piston engine, a frontal electric motor and two smaller motors on the wing-tips. A tadpole-shaped fuselage with low-wing and V-tail was selected. Both airplanes are identical except for the flight controller, motors and batteries which results in an 83% part-commonality by weight and this can help achieve minimal development, certification, and manufacturing costs. Based on the aircraft weight, complexity, and performance, the Eastlake cost model estimates the aircraft to be highly competitively to various aircraft of similar performance in terms of initial and operational costs.","tags":"","title":"hyBIRD: Design of a Four and Six Seater Hybrid-Electric Aircraft Family","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
